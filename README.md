## Basic Arithmetic Calculator

- The goal of this application is to create a basic arithmetic calculator that can save all previous operations performed on it.
- Although I have a login page, there is no authentication strategy in place because I was short on time.
- I used tailwindCSS as my CSS framework because I was more familiar with it since I have used it before.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I got 100% in all four lighthouse tests for both the login page and the main page.
